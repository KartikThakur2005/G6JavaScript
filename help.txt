Question : What is Low level language and high level language ?
Answer : Low level language : The code in form of 0 and 1
         High level language : In form of English

Question : What is interpretated and compiled language ?
Answer : Interpenetrated : Line by line give result
         Complied : First compile whole code  then give result

Question : What is single threaded language ?
Answer : One work at one time

Question : What is JavaScript ?
Answer : JavaScript is a high level, interpretated and single thread language


Question : What are variable ?
Answer : A container in which we can store data

Question : What is let, var and const ?
Answer : Const - Whose value is not changed
         let -  we can update but not redeclared  it
         var - but in var we can do both



Question : Types of Datatypes ?
Answer : 1> Primitive  : Which cannot be further divided
         2> Non Primitive : Array, Object


Question : What is difference between == and === ?
Answer : === is strict equality also check number with datatype
          == only check value

Question : What is ternary operator ?
Answer : a > b ? c : d

Question : What is function ?
Answer : A block of code which can be called in future


---------------------------------- String Method ----------------------------------------------------

1> replace : str.replace("this", "to this value")
             but this will replace onmy first value which is encountered
2> split : str.split("basis")
           str.split("basis", 2) --> these fill tell only first two word from which basis is removed

3> floor vs ceil
    floor previous value : 3.5 -> 3
    ceil : 3.5 -> 4





------------------------------------------ Function ------------------------------------------------

Question : What is function declaration ?
Answer : we literally declare a function  calc()

Question : What are anonymous function ?
Answer : These are those function without name

Question : What is function expression ?
Answer : Those function which are stored inside the variable  and important is that these return
         value  if there is no return statement it will return undefined
         Question : How does it work ?
         Answer : The thing is the reference of function is passed into variable
                  and the function is invoked by that variable
         Question : What is a name is given to anonymous function in function expression ?
         Answer : it does not matter it will not work outside that function  it can be
                  used inside


Question : What is main difference between function expression and function declaration ?
Answer : We can call function declaration before declaring
         We cannot do that in function expression

Question : What is arrow function ?
Answer : Shorter form of function expression
         const calcAge = (birthYear) => 2023 - Year




----------------------------------------- Basic of Arrays ------------------------------------------

Question : What is difference between
           let arr = [1, 2, 3] and let arr = new Array(2) and let arr = new Array(3, 4)
 
           1> let arr = [1, 2, 3] this is simple way of declaring
           2> let arr = new Array(2) this will define size
           3> let arr = new Array(2, 3, 4) this will


Question : What if we make const array ?
Answer : The value will be changes because const work for primitive  value


Question : What are different method of Array ?
Answer : a> push() - Add element to last of array
                     and return length of latest array
 
         b> unshift() - add element to beginning of array
         c> pop() - remove the last element of array
         d> shift() - remove removes first element of array




----------------------------------- Basic of objects -------------------------------------------------

Question : What is object ?
Answer : Object store the data in the form of key and values

Question : What is object literal ?
Answer : let obj = {};


Question : What is ways for extracting value from object ?
Answer : by dot (.)
         by []
         Question : What is difference between . and [] ?
         Answer :  In dot we have to use real property name
 
                   we can do any expression in []
                  let x = "name"
                  obj["fist" + x]


Question : How to add key in the object ?
Answer : a> obj.keyName = "value";x`
         b> onj[keyName] = "value";

Question : Why template literal allow ternary operator but not if else ?
Answer  : Because template literal : allow only evaluation of expression
          but the if else if an statement






------------------------------------ DOM ---------------------------------------------

Question : How to select a element ?
Answer : By document.querySelector(.)   . ->class
                                        # ->id

Question : What is DOM in JavaScript ?
Answer : DOM - Document Object Model Is the structured representation of Html document
         Dom helps JavaScript to access elements of html
 
Question : How DOM Works ?
Answer : DOM is created automatically by the browser
         Document object is created at the top of tree which serve as the entry point to DOM
         Actually the DOM is the part of browser API













-------------------------- How JavaScript work ? ---------------------------------------

Question : How JavaScript Work ?
Answer : JavaScript Runtime environment contains 2 things : 1> Call Stack - Where actually a code run
                                                            2> Heap - Where objects are stored

        Before going to move we should know :
        a> Compiles time language -  1> Source code - Portable machine code - Execution - Running of program
        b> Interpreted language - Executes code line by line
        c> JTI : Jut in time Interpreted :  Source code : Machine code (No portable code) - Running of program

 
                              Code enters into the JS engine
                                             |
                                 Parsing : Syntax Checking
                                             |
                                 Compilation : Machine code
                                             |
                                         Execution

Actually along with this JS runtime environment also contain : Web API : DOM Manipulation
And also provide Callback Queue where all the callback function like onclick are added which wait for
the call stack to be emptied



Question : How JavaScript run code ?
Answer : First When code is converted into machine code a global execution context is made
         Global execution context - which is not inside a function means globally
         then when it starts to run it will create separate execution context for each function

Question : What is execution context made up of ?
Answer : 1> Variable Environment
         2> Arguments object : All the arguments which are passed to that function
         3> Scope chain : Means will contain all the reference of variables which are above that function
         4> this

Question : Does arrow function have execution context ?
Answer : Yes but it does not have his own this and Argument object


After when all the function are executed all the function are removed from the call stack and
only the global execution context remains waiting for the all callback function send by event loop

Question : What is scoping ?
Answer : Range up to which we can access a variable
        1> Global Scope : The variable declared here can be accessed everywhere
        2> Block Scope :  The local scope within a {} but the main difference is that let and const are block scoped but
                          var can be accessed outside that scope
        3> Function Scope : The local scope within function




Question : What is Hoisting ?
Answer : Hoisting makes some variable accessible before they are declared

                                 Hoisted                          Initial Value                               Scope
         function declaration :  Yes                                Actual Function                           Block
         var variables           Yes                               Undefined                                 Function
         let and const           ❌No                              error (TDZ)                                block
  function expression and arrow                          Depends upon if created with var or let


Question : What is TDZ Temporal dead zone ?
Answer : scope until which the let and const are not declared with value
         and also for const : const cannot be assigned and redeclared

Question : Why Hoisting ?
Answer : For using function before actual declaration


Question : Difference between let var and const >
Answer :
        let                                              |           var                                                      | const
1> let cannot be re declared but can be updated            1> Var can do both it can be redeclared and re update              1> it cannot do both
2> let is block scoped means if else block                 2> var is not block scope it ignores if else                       2> is also block scoped
3> let is not window property                              3> var is window.x = x                                             3> const is also not window property
4>                                                        4> var get value during memory execution




Question : What is this ?
Answer : this refers to things who is calling that function

         Method : means inside the object➡️ this  = object that is calling the method
         simple function :➡️ this = undefined
         Arrow function :➡️ this  = < this of surrounding (lexical this) parent this >
         Event listener :➡️this = < DOM element that handle is attached to >


const obj = {
   name : "kartik",
   gree : () => {
    console.log(this.name)
 }
}

Jonas.greet() -- this will give undefined because we know arrow function do not have  his own this it support lexical
                 this




Question : Difference between arrow function and simple function ?
Answer : 1> Arrow function does not have its own this it takes of parent
         2> Arrow does not have arguments



Question : Memory management in JavaScript ?
Answer :  There are two types of variables 1> Primitive
                                           2> Object

Now the primitive are stored int the : Call Stack in execution context
Now the non primitive are stored int the : Heap

let obj = {
 name : "kartik"
}

let temp = obj - this will refers to reference which is stored in the heap
now if we do this

temp.name = "Thakur" - this will change the obj name also  because of reference



Question : What 🙎🔎is deep and shallow copy ?
Answer : Shallow copy : We only copied first level see below example  (... spread)
          Depp coy : make nested copy also  structuredClone()
 



Question : What is spread operator ... ?
Answer : ... spread operator take out array  the elements out of array and object
         we cannot use it in `${...arr}` because multiple value are accepted in function
          or when we built a new array and `${}` is used to evaluate expression

Question : What is rest operator ?
Answer : Rest do opposite of spread operator collect multiple element into single array

Question : What is default in ... while making
Answer : ...spread will make shallow copy but the thing it will make copy of all properties
         but in this case
 
         let  obj = {
         name : "kartik",
         arr : [1, 2],
         }

         but here it will make copy of refernce
 
         let temp = {...obj}
         if we do tem.arr.push(3)  - this will change obj array

         🔎 Soution : Make deep copy


Question : What is destructing ?
Answer : It is breaking complex data structure into variable
         let [a, , c] = arr;
         but DE structuring make shallow copy



Destructing of Object :

Question : How to change key name while destructing object ?
Answer : let [name : resturent_name] = obj;
 




------------------------- ASYNC JAVA -----------------------------
Question : Do callback function make async JavaScript ?
Answer : No only callback do not make async JavaScript because map is also
         call back function and it does not do async JavaScript


Question : What is AJAX ?
Answer : Asynchronous JavaScript and XML allow us to communicate with remote web server
         in a Asynchronous way, with AJAX we can request data from web server dynamically



Question : How async works ?

You write: fetch('...').then(res => ...)

⬇

1. JS Engine:
   Calls fetch(), sees it's async
   ⟶ Passes it to Browser Web API

2. Browser Web API:
   Does the actual HTTP request in background

3. Once done:
   Places callback (res => ...) into Callback Queue

4. Event Loop:
   Waits for main thread to be free
   ⟶ Moves callback to Call Stack

5. JS Engine:
   Executes the callback (res => ...)


Question : What is API ?
Answer : Application programming Interface if a piece of software that can be used by other piece of
software to communicate with each other

Question : What to use Ajax ?
Answer : let request = new XMLTttpReuest(); old way
         1> use have to open request.open('Get', URL)
         2> use have to send request.send()
         3> ue have to add event listner load request.addEventListener('load', function() {



Question : What is callBack hell?
Answer : It exution of nexted callBack to achieve asynchronous task in squence

Question : What is promisies ?
Answer : Promisie is a container for asynchronous returned value

Question : What is use of promisies ?
Answer : 1> We no longer need to depend upon callback function and event
         2> Instead of nesting callback we can use promises chaning to escape
            callback hell

Question : What is lifecycle of promises ?
Answer : Promisies work on async function so it goes on different state
         1> Pending : Before future value is returned
         2> Settled : Fulfilled and REJECTED

        But these state will be calculated only once

Question : How to use promise ?
Answer : If promise is resolved the the reuslt will promise we have to extract that data
         by using then
 
         fetch().then(function(response) {
              return response --> we have to convert into JSON format
             so do
             return response.JSON() --> Now this json is also async function so we have to do use
                                        then
         }).then(function(data) {
              console.log(data);
         })


Question : What is promise chaning ?
Answer : Istead of callback hell we have flat chain

Question : How to handle if promise is rejected ?
Answer : There are 2 wayss to handle
         1> Pass another call back function in then
            then(callback for resolved, callback for rejected)

         2> By adding catch at the end of  then this will catch erro that occur at any then

Question : What is finally ?
Answer : No matter a promise is fulfilled or rejected this will be called



Question : What is imediate inoveked function





Question : What are clousers ?
Answer : function binds itself with its lexical scope
         every time a new clouser will be created with every function

  
 
       function foo() {
          let a = 10;
           function fun() {
             a++;
             console.log(a);
           }

         return foo;
       }


let help = foo();

consloe.log(help()) ---> prints 11 becuase of closer


Question : What is use of clouser ?
Answer : To make something private becuse there is not concept of private in javaScript

Question : What is disadvantage of clouser >
Answer : Over consumption of memory 

Question : What is memoisation ?
Answer :   by doing couser

         let dp = [] --> by declaring it globaly it can be changed by any one

         so use clouser
 
         function cl() {
         let store = []
 
         return function mult(a){
           if(store[a]) {
                 return store[a];
           }

           return store[a] = a * 5;

         }

        }

 

Question : What is curring function in javaScript ?
Answer : Convert multiple parameter into one parameter fucntion
         or are those which take one perameter at a time

          function sum(a) {
            return function(b) {
              return function(c) {
                  // here this will have all argument becuase of clouser
                  a + b + c;
               }

             }
        }

         sum(1)(2)(3);






Question : Sysnc vs Async
           Sync execute code line by line
           Async does not wait for any one


           JavaScript is single threaded and synchronus language




Question : What setTimeOut and setIntervale are ?
Answer :  these both will delay the execution of code

          setTimeOut() will invoke function only 1 time
          setIntrerval will invoke function every time


Question : What setTimeout and setInterval return ?
Answer : They return unique integer and used to clear that function that is not needed
        by clearInterval of setInterval and cleartime for setTimeout

Question : What is micorqueue ?
Answer : It has more priority than callback function


Question : How javaScript handle these async function ?
